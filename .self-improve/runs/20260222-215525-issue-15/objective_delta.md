# Objective Delta Proposal

## Current Objective
Ship a lightweight, reliable shell RAG runtime for fast agent querying over indexed documents.

## Signals
- full_pass: false
- uncovered_steps: 0
- missing_expected_touches: 2
- repeated_failure_fingerprint_count: 1

## Proposed Adjustment
- Keep objective unchanged by default (propose_then_approve).
- Add explicit acceptance line-items for the recurring uncovered/missing validation surfaces.
